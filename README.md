I programmed a fully-functional Pong game in Python using tkinter during my freshman year at UMass Amherst. I learned the fundamentals of OOP and gained valuable debugging skills as well. Divided aspects of the game like the racket and ball into separate classes and created individual functions and methods. Exposure to modules such as tkinter helped with the front end design of the application. Multiple modes are available, such as 1 and 2 player mode. I also added some cool features like making the angle of the ball's impact be randomized as well as its velocity to increase difficulty.
